# Fingerprints

## This project looks at fingerprint similarities between statins with a goal to see which molecules are similar
to one another. Molecular fingerprinting is a technique used to represent molecules as binary vectors or strings,
where each bit or character in the vector or string represents a specific feature of the molecule. This allows for
the efficient comparison ofmolecules, as the similarity between two molecules can be calculated by comparing their
fingerprints.
